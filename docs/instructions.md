    Multi-Role Sales Dashboard UI/UX Layout Guide
    This guide details a high-fidelity Power BI dashboard design for multiple sales roles (Executive, Manager, Field Sales Rep, Business Development). It translates the functional blueprint into actionable UI/UX specifications, including page layouts, visual component sizing/styling, interactivity, and visual polish. All measurements assume a 16:9 Power BI canvas (1280×720 px) with a 12-column grid and ~20px padding/gaps for a clean, consistent alignment
    notjustaprettydashboard.com
    . Consistency across pages is emphasized to ensure a unified look and feel.
    Executive Dashboard Page
    Layout Structure and Zones
    Grid: 12-column, 3-row layout on a standard 1280×720 canvas (aspect 16:9). Use ~20px margins and gutters between visuals for ample white space
    notjustaprettydashboard.com
    . Even a 1–2px misalignment can appear sloppy, so snap visuals to the grid for pixel-perfect alignment
    notjustaprettydashboard.com
    .
    Zones:
    Top Zone (Key KPIs) – A single row at the top containing 4 KPI tiles (each spanning 3 columns). This zone highlights high-level metrics at a glance.
    Middle Zone (Trends & Breakdown) – Second row split into two visuals (each ~6 columns wide). Left is a broad trend chart; right is a summary chart (e.g. pipeline funnel or regional breakdown).
    Bottom Zone (Detailed Insights) – Third row with two half-width visuals (each ~6 columns). One might be a breakdown chart (e.g. product mix pie or top customers bar), and the other a compact table or matrix of top entries. These are aligned horizontally. (If a full-width table is needed, use the entire 12-column width in this zone and omit the second visual.)
    Spacing & Alignment: Ensure a 20px gap between each tile and around the page edges for visual breathing room
    notjustaprettydashboard.com
    . All visuals in a row should be bottom-aligned. Section headings (if any) should left-align with the grid columns to create a neat vertical rhythm.
    Visual Components
    KPI Tiles (4) – Use Card visuals for single-value KPIs (e.g. Total YTD Sales, YoY Growth, Pipeline Value, Conversion Rate). Each card ~3 columns (≈300px) wide and ~150px tall. Title (category) text ~12–15pt, semibold, uppercase; value text ~25–28pt, semibold/bold for emphasis
    medium.com
    . Center-align content within cards (or left-align if an icon is placed to the left). Format numbers with one decimal and units (e.g. 1.2M) for compactness. Apply conditional color formatting: e.g. green text if above target, red if below. Consider small KPI status icons (▲▼) next to values, colored via conditional rules (green up arrow for above-threshold, red down for below)
    creatum.online
    . Turn off category labels on these cards if the card title serves as the label.
    Sales Trend Chart – A Clustered Column & Line combo showing performance over time (e.g. monthly sales columns vs target line). Size ~6 columns (≈620px) wide by ~2 rows tall (≈220px). Include a clear title (e.g. Monthly Sales vs Target) at ~12pt bold. X-axis (months) font ~10pt; Y-axis font ~10pt; both in semi-bold for readability. Data labels on columns at ~9pt (if space allows) showing values in K (e.g. 450K). The target line should have data labels or an end label for the target value. Use a muted color for actual bars and a contrasting accent for the target line to make it distinguishable. Enable drill-down on the time hierarchy (Year > Quarter > Month), with an on-visual drill button for intuitive navigation
    simplebi.net
    .
    Pipeline Funnel – A Funnel visual illustrating pipeline stages (Lead → Qualified → Quote → Won). Size ~6 columns wide by ~2 rows tall (to ensure stage labels fit). Title ~12pt bold (Sales Funnel – All Regions). Stage labels inside the funnel at ~10pt; values either as data labels (in % of total and absolute) at ~10pt. Use the theme accent colors in gradient (e.g. darker at top for higher-stage values, lighter at bottom). Apply conditional formatting on funnel segments: e.g. if drop-off between stages exceeds a threshold, color that segment differently or add an alert icon. Tooltip: configure a custom tooltip (or report page tooltip) to show detailed stage definitions or historical comparisons when hovering on a stage.
    Product Mix Donut – (Optional visual) A Donut chart breaking down YTD sales by product category. Size ~6 columns by ~1.5 rows (if paired with a table). Ensure the donut’s diameter is large enough for category labels (~10pt) to be legible. Place the percentage or value in the center as a callout (e.g. highlight the largest segment’s share). Legend below or to the right in ~9–10pt font, or use direct labels on slices if clear.
    Top 10 Customers Table – A Table visual listing top 10 customers by revenue. Size ~6 columns by ~1.5 rows (if sharing the row with the donut) or full 12-column width if alone. Columns: Customer Name, Sales, YOY Growth%. Use a matrix if hierarchical grouping is needed (e.g. by region > customer). Column headers ~10pt bold; values ~10pt. Apply data bars or conditional formatting: e.g. a bar or green/red coloring in the YOY Growth column to quickly flag growth vs decline
    creatum.online
    . Keep the table height sufficient (~200px) to avoid vertical scroll for 10 rows. Enable row-level drill-through on customer name to a detailed customer report (e.g. navigate to a drill-through page with full customer history) for deeper analysis.
    Interaction Design
    Filters/Slicers: Place a date slicer (e.g. fiscal year/quarter dropdown or a horizontal timeline slicer) at top of the page, above or beside the KPI tiles (in a top ribbon). Use a dropdown slicer style to save space if many periods. Additionally, an optional Region slicer (if the executive wants to filter the whole dashboard by region) can be placed as a dropdown next to the date slicer. These slicers should use ~12pt font for selected values for visibility. Placing slicers in a top colored ribbon makes them prominent and aligned by importance
    reddit.com
    . They should be clearly labeled (e.g. “Filter: Quarter”) either via the slicer header or an adjacent text label.
    Drill Paths: Implement intuitive drill-down and drill-through. For example, clicking on a bar in the sales trend (or a specific region in a breakdown chart) can drill through to a Territory/Region Detail page filtered to that context
    simplebi.net
    . The funnel stages might allow drill-through to a separate page showing the list of opportunities at that stage. Right-click context menus on charts should be enabled for these drill-through actions with clear tooltip hints (e.g. “Right-click to see Region Details”).
    Navigation: Include a consistent navigation menu for role pages. At the top of the Executive page, have a horizontal set of navigation buttons (or use Power BI’s Page Navigator feature) listing each dashboard page (Executive, Manager, Field, BD). The current page’s button is highlighted distinctly
    interworks.com
    . For instance, a page navigator will auto-generate one button per page and highlight “Executive” when on that page
    interworks.com
    . Style these as tabs or pill-shaped buttons (e.g. ~14pt font). This allows the executive to switch to other views if needed (assuming proper access). Also consider a “Reset Filters” button (small, top-right) to clear slicers, using the default bookmark.
    Visual Design and Polish
    Background: Use a subtle background to differentiate sections. For example, the top KPI zone could have a light shading or a faint corporate logo watermark behind it at ~5–10% transparency, highlighting it as a header section. The rest of the page can remain white or a very light gray (#F9F9F9) for contrast with visual borders. Use a thin separator line (a 1px horizontal rule or a colored bar) below the KPI zone as a divider.
    Icons and Labels: Enhance at-a-glance comprehension with icons. Each KPI card can include a small icon: e.g. a dollar sign 💰 for sales, a trend arrow for growth, a funnel icon for pipeline, a percentage icon for conversion. These icons (use an SVG or Font Awesome icon) can sit to the left of the KPI label or in a top corner of the card. Keep them monochromatic in the card’s text color for subtlety. Section titles (if used, like “Top Customers”) can also have an icon (👤 for customers) prefixed. Maintain a uniform icon style (line icons or solid, but consistent weight) across the report for professionalism.
    Text Styling: Use the organization’s font if possible (or a clean sans-serif like Segoe UI for consistency). Titles 12–14pt bold, body/labels ~10pt. Ensure high contrast between text and background for accessibility (e.g. dark charcoal text #333 on light backgrounds)
    thebricks.com
    . KPI values should stand out with a larger size and maybe a heavier weight than other numbers. Avoid excessive all-caps except for short labels or acronyms to preserve readability.
    Conditional Formatting & Wow Factor: Apply intuitive color cues – e.g. green for positive increases and red for negatives, as mentioned. KPI tiles might use a subtle colored background or indicator bar on the side that turns green or red based on performance (instead of coloring the whole card). Leverage conditional icons in tables: a ↑ or ↓ icon next to growth values (colored appropriately) to quickly signal direction
    creatum.online
    . These little touches add a “wow” factor and make the data story clearer.
    Tooltip Customization: Provide rich tooltips on key visuals. For example, hovering on the “Total Sales” KPI might show a breakdown by division in a tooltip, or hovering on a month in the trend chart could show that month’s detailed metrics (sales, target, variance). Use Report page tooltips with custom layouts for a polished look (e.g. a mini-chart or additional text in the tooltip).
    Maintainability: All styling uses native Power BI features (no custom visuals), ensuring easy maintenance. The Executive page visuals are standard (Cards, Combo Chart, Funnel, Donut, Table). This native approach avoids performance issues and keeps the report lightweight.
    Manager Dashboard Page
    Layout Structure and Zones
    Grid: Same 12-column structure (1280×720 canvas). The layout for Managers parallels the Executive page for familiarity, but with content tuned to the manager’s scope. Maintain the 20px margins/gaps and snap-to-grid alignment
    notjustaprettydashboard.com
    .
    Zones:
    Top Zone (Manager KPIs) – 4 KPI cards (3 columns each) highlighting the manager’s key metrics (e.g. Region Sales, % to Target, Team Pipeline, New Leads). Align and size identical to the executive KPIs zone for consistency.
    Middle Zone (Team Performance Charts) – One row with two half-width visuals (6 columns each). For example: a bar chart on the left (team member performance), and a funnel or target attainment chart on the right.
    Bottom Zone (Detailed Team Data) – A full-width table or two half-width visuals. In this case, a full-width table is recommended (12 columns) to list team-level details (since managers often need tabular detail of their team). If a single table is used, center it in the grid and ensure ~20px padding on sides. If two visuals are used instead, split into 6/6 columns similar to the Executive layout.
    Visual Components
    KPIs (4) – Four Card visuals for manager-specific metrics: e.g. Regional Sales (MTD), Target Achievement (%), Open Opportunities, Team Size or New Accounts. Dimensions and style same as Exec KPI cards (3col x ~150px each). Titles reflect the scope (“Region Sales”, etc.). Font sizes ~25pt for values, ~12pt for labels
    medium.com
    . If a KPI is a percentage, format e.g. “85%” with one decimal if needed. Use conditional coloring/icons as well (e.g. a target achievement KPI shows a green check icon if >100%, red if <90%).
    Team Performance Bar Chart – A Clustered Bar chart ranking something like Sales by Salesperson (for the manager’s team). Size ~6 columns wide x 2 rows tall. Title “Sales by Team Member” 12pt bold. X-axis (sales amount) can be hidden to maximize space; data labels on bars (value in K) at ~10pt for direct reading. Y-axis lists reps’ names in 10pt font. Order bars descending to highlight top performers at top. Apply data bar colors from the theme (e.g. corporate blue for all bars, but highlight the manager’s own name or target average if included). This chart should allow drill-through: right-clicking a salesperson’s bar could drill to that individual’s detailed page (or filter the Field Rep page, if accessible), so managers can jump to a rep’s perspective.
    Pipeline/Target Gauge or Funnel – On the right, show either a Gauge or Funnel visual focusing on the manager’s pipeline or target attainment. If using a Gauge: width ~6 columns, height ~2 rows (a wide gauge). Configure it with actual vs target (e.g. YTD sales vs annual target). Show the needle at current value and target marker; label the target on the gauge (“Target: $5M”). The gauge’s numeric callout (current % of target) should be ~20pt bold in the center, with the gauge scale labels in ~10pt. If using a Pipeline Funnel instead (similar to Exec but filtered to the manager’s region/team), maintain same sizing (~6 columns, 2 rows). Title accordingly (e.g. “Team Sales Funnel”). Stage values should reflect only their team’s pipeline. Either visual should use conditional colors (e.g. gauge fills green beyond 100%, yellow for 80–100%, red below 80%).
    Team Performance Table – A Matrix/Table listing each team member with key metrics. Full width (12 cols) to fit multiple columns without horizontal scroll. Columns might include: Rep Name, MTD Sales, QTD Sales, % Target Achieved, Pipeline Value. Use ~10pt font for values, slightly larger 11pt bold for headers. Enable conditional formatting: e.g. cell background or icons for % Target (green up arrow if >100%, yellow if 80–100%, red down arrow if <80%)
    creatum.online
    . Freeze the header row and enable a vertical scrollbar if more than ~8 rows (so the layout isn’t stretched if the team has many members). This table gives the manager a detailed at-a-glance of their entire team. Drill-through could be enabled here as well (right-click a rep to go to rep page).
    (Optional Alternative) If a full table is too dense, consider splitting bottom zone into two visuals: for instance, a Top Opportunities table (5 largest deals in the region) on left 6 columns, and a Product Breakdown pie chart on right 6 columns (showing sales by product line for the region). This would mimic the Exec layout pattern. However, ensure the key detailed info (team performance) is covered either way.
    Interaction Design
    Slicers: Similar to Exec, include a Time slicer (e.g. Year/Quarter) at top. For managers, a product category slicer could also be useful if they want to filter visuals by product line. Use a horizontal dropdown slicer or chiclet slicer for products with multi-select. Align these slicers in the top ribbon, consistently styled with ~12pt font. Because a manager’s data is likely already restricted to their region via RLS, a region slicer isn’t needed; instead, provide other relevant filters like product or customer segment. Keep slicers clear and intuitive – possibly with an “Apply All” button if many slicers (or set slicers to instantly apply on selection).
    Drill/Navigation: The page navigator (role menu) appears here too, so the manager can switch to Exec or other pages if permitted. Provide drill-down within charts where applicable: e.g. on the product breakdown pie (if present) allow drill-down from product category to sub-category. The bar chart might allow drilling from individual to product mix for that individual if a hierarchy is set. Drill-through: definitely allow jumping from a team summary to an individual’s page. When the manager right-clicks a rep name (in chart or table), offer a drill-through to the Field Sales page filtered for that rep – giving a quick way to see that rep’s perspective. Similarly, could allow drill-through from a product in the pie chart to a product detail page (if one exists).
    Additional Interactions: The manager page might use Bookmarks to toggle between views of the table – e.g. a toggle to switch the Team Performance table between Sales metrics and Activity metrics. If the blueprint includes multiple metric sets, consider a button that switches measure displays (using bookmarks or field parameters). For example, a toggle for “Sales vs. Pipeline” could switch the bar chart from showing Sales by Rep to Pipeline by Rep. If using, place toggle buttons near the charts, styled as a small pill button group. Provide subtle visual feedback (selected state) on the active toggle.
    Visual Design and Polish
    Consistent Theme: The manager page follows the common theme (see Global Guidelines). All colors and fonts mirror the executive page for continuity
    creatum.online
    . For instance, KPI cards use the same background color and style, only the content (titles) differ. This consistency helps users feel they’re in the same report family when switching pages.
    Role-Specific Accents: To give the Manager page its own identity, include a small icon or label indicating it’s the Manager view. For example, the page title “Sales Manager Dashboard” at the top-left, with an icon of a briefcase or a team (👥) next to it. Use the primary brand color for this icon to distinguish the role. You might also use a slightly different highlight color for manager-specific visuals (e.g. the bars in the team chart could be a secondary color to differentiate from similar charts on the Exec page). Keep such accent changes subtle and within the approved palette.
    Background and Sections: Use a similar background approach as Exec – perhaps the KPI zone has a light tinted background bar behind it spanning the page width (e.g. a very light blue overlay rectangle) to set it apart. The rest can remain plain. If the manager page is content-heavy, ensure proper separation: e.g. a thin line or increased padding between the middle charts and bottom table to visually delineate the sections.
    Text & Iconography: All text styling remains consistent (titles 12–14pt, body ~10pt). Icons can be used next to KPI labels (e.g. a target 🎯 icon for “% to Target”, a pipeline icon for pipeline volume). In the team table, consider small inline icons in headers (like a ▲ in the “% Target” header cell to indicate sorting or direction of good/bad). Use the same icon set as Exec page to maintain design language.
    Conditional Highlights: The manager page can use conditional formatting for emphasis. For example, highlight the row of the top performer in the team table with a subtle background shade, or use a star ★ icon for the #1 rep. Similarly, if any KPI is below a critical threshold (e.g. <50% to target), you might add a warning icon (⚠️) next to it or color the card border red. These cues quickly draw the manager’s attention to areas needing action.
    Ease of Maintenance: All visuals utilize built-in formatting options. The use of a consistent theme means changes to the JSON theme file (for colors/fonts) will update across pages, ensuring maintainability. The layout grid ensures that if visuals need rearranging or resizing, they snap and align without manual pixel tweaking.
    Field Sales Rep Dashboard Page
    Layout Structure and Zones
    Grid: 12-column layout with identical margins/gaps. For the field rep (individual salesperson) view, the structure again echoes the prior pages for familiarity. However, content density can be lighter since a rep usually focuses on their own metrics and pipeline.
    Zones:
    Top Zone (Rep KPIs) – 3 or 4 KPI cards (3-column each) summarizing the rep’s performance (e.g. Personal Sales, % Quota Achieved, Active Opportunities, perhaps Avg Deal Size or Calls Made if relevant). If only 3 KPIs are needed, center them or leave the 4th card blank for symmetry.
    Middle Zone (Rep Charts) – Two half-width visuals side by side (each ~6 columns). Likely a performance trend and a pipeline/funnel.
    Bottom Zone (Detailed Pipeline/Table) – Full width visual (12 columns) showing the rep’s pipeline detail or activities. Alternatively, two 6-column visuals if splitting details (e.g. a small table and a secondary chart).
    Visual Components
    KPIs (3–4) – Card visuals for individual metrics: YTD Sales, Quota Attainment %, Open Opportunities Count/Value, Win Rate or Call Productivity (whatever key metrics the rep tracks). Each card ~3 columns wide, styled like previous KPI tiles. Value font ~25pt bold, label ~12pt
    medium.com
    . If using 4 KPIs, do as before; if 3, you can still use 4 slots and one blank for symmetry or adjust each card to ~4 columns wide. Apply conditional formatting to indicate performance vs quota: e.g. the Quota % card could have a colored background: green if >=100%, amber 80–99%, red <80%. Or use an icon overlay (trophy 🏆 for >=100%, etc.). These cards should personalize the data (“My Sales”, “My Pipeline”) to reinforce that it’s the rep’s own dashboard.
    Sales Trend (Rep) – A Line chart showing the rep’s sales over time (e.g. monthly bookings trend). Size ~6 columns x 2 rows. Title “My Sales Trend (Month)” 12pt bold. X-axis: months (or weeks) in 10pt, Y-axis: sales in 10pt. Plot a single line for the rep’s actual sales, possibly with a shaded area under it. If there is a target line for the rep, include it as a second line or use area under target vs over target shading. Data labels optional (maybe label last point only to avoid clutter). Include an average or goal reference in a subtle way (maybe a horizontal constant line for quota if applicable). This chart likely doesn’t need drill-down (since individual data is flat), but could allow zoom on timeframe via slicer. Ensure tooltips on each point show the exact value and period.
    Pipeline Funnel (Rep) – A Funnel chart of the rep’s own sales pipeline by stage. Same size ~6 columns x 2 rows. Title “My Pipeline by Stage”. Format similar to previous funnels: stage labels 10pt, values in data labels 10pt inside shapes or alongside. Likely fewer total values, so this funnel might look sparse – consider using a Stacked Bar chart as an alternative to funnel for better comparison of stage values if needed (with bars representing each stage’s value). However, funnel is a quick visual cue for drop-off. Color the funnel in one of the theme’s sequences. As before, use conditional formatting if certain stages have very low conversion (maybe highlight that stage label). Tooltips could list key deals in that stage for context (via a report page tooltip).
    Active Deals Table – A Table listing the rep’s active opportunities or recently closed deals. Full 12-column width for readability. Include columns like: Opportunity Name, Stage, Value, Close Date. Use ~10pt font (slightly smaller if more columns to fit). Possibly apply a icon condition on Stage or probability (e.g. a 🔥 icon for hot deals nearing close). Allow this table to scroll vertically if the rep has many deals (height ~250px to show ~8–10 rows at once). The rep can use this as a worklist. Enable conditional formatting: for example, highlight deals closing in the current month (Close Date within 30 days) with a light highlight, or use red text for any deal past its close date. If applicable, allow drill-through from a deal to a more detailed CRM page or record (though if Power BI is the end-interface, perhaps not needed).
    (Optional Visual) Performance vs Team – If the rep might benefit from seeing where they stand, include a small rank bar chart: e.g. a horizontal bar chart showing all team members’ sales with the rep’s bar highlighted. This could be a thin visual beneath the trend (e.g. 12 columns wide but only ~1 row tall). Title “Team Ranking”. Bars minimal height, rep’s bar in accent color, others in neutral gray. Label the values or at least rank positions. This gives a bit of competitive context as a “wow” factor. (If adding this, ensure it doesn’t overwhelm; it might be better as a tooltip or on-demand via a bookmark toggle to avoid sensitive data exposure.)
    Interaction Design
    Slicers: A field rep likely needs fewer filters since they’re already scoped to their data (via RLS or by design). Provide a Date slicer (to filter their metrics by month/quarter). A simple dropdown or between slider for date range works. Place it top-left or top-center above KPIs, labeled clearly (e.g. “Period: [Q3 2025]”). Optionally, a slicer for Product or Customer might help a rep focus on a subset of their pipeline. If so, use a small dropdown slicer to the right of the date slicer. Keep slicer visuals consistent with the rest (same font and style). Since space is typically available (fewer visuals overall), you might place slicers as slightly larger dropdowns or even horizontal button slicers (Chiclet style) for something like pipeline stage filtering. Ensure any slicer choices are reflected in the page title or a subtitle for clarity (or simply visible in slicer selection itself).
    Drill/Details: The rep page might not need drill-down within visuals (as their data is likely flat). However, drill-through can be offered to see more detail about an item. For example, right-clicking an opportunity in the Active Deals table could drill through to a detailed page showing that deal’s full info (if a detailed page is available or perhaps open a URL to CRM record if configured). If a team ranking chart is shown, that might allow drilling up to the manager view, but typically a rep wouldn’t have access to others’ data. So likely, drill actions are minimal here. Instead, focus on interactive sorting in the table (reps can click column headers to sort by value or date), and maybe use Bookmarks for toggling between different views of their data (e.g. a bookmark to switch the Active Deals table to a Closed Deals table). A toggle button could be placed above the table (“View: Active | Closed”) – clicking it switches visuals via bookmarks. This gives a nice interactive control for the rep to self-service more info without leaving their page.
    Navigation: The page navigator is present, but if reps are not meant to access Exec/Manager pages, in deployment those might be hidden via security. In design, you can include all, but highlight the Field page tab on this page. Possibly use an icon of a user or target on the Field page’s navigation button to make it visually distinct. The rep page might also include a link or button to external systems (e.g. “Open CRM”) as a call-to-action. If so, use a standard Button visual with an icon (like an external link arrow) and configure the action to Web URL. Keep it small and placed in a corner to not distract from data.
    Visual Design and Polish
    Empathetic Design: As this page is for individual contributors, personalize the experience. For instance, have the page title say “My Sales Dashboard” instead of “Field Sales” once a rep is viewing their own data – it feels more personal. You could even greet them with their name (if available via a DAX measure or parameter: e.g. “Hello, [Rep Name] – here’s your status”). This can be a text box at top in a friendly italic or lighter font ~14pt.
    Visual Cue and Icons: Use icons that resonate with personal performance: a target 🎯 icon for quota, a handshake 🤝 for deals closed, a phone 📞 for calls made (if those metrics exist). Place these in KPI cards or near titles as done on other pages. Ensure they are small (maybe 16px) and don’t clutter the numbers. A slight playful element can be introduced here (since it’s an internal personal dashboard) – e.g. if they hit 100% quota, maybe show a trophy 🏆 icon in the Quota KPI. Use conditional measures to display such icons dynamically (via UNICHAR symbols in a card, etc.). These little rewards add a motivational “wow” factor for the rep.
    Color Usage: All colors follow the approved palette. However, since this is personal data, you might use the secondary accent more liberally to highlight the rep specifically. For example, in the optional team rank chart, the rep’s bar is in the primary accent color while others are gray – focusing the eye on “you”. Throughout, ensure positive metrics (e.g. above quota) are in green tones and negative in red, consistent with the legend and other pages. Keep backgrounds simple; likely a white or very light background throughout, to maximize readability on smaller laptop screens that reps might use on the go.
    Font & Readability: Font sizes remain in the 10–12pt range. Reps might access this on various devices, so test that the text is legible on smaller screens. Avoid going below ~11pt for any detail text
    thebricks.com
    . The mobile design (discussed later) especially benefits the field user, so ensure the styling is clean and not overly crowded.
    Maintaining Simplicity: This page should feel less “corporate overview” and more “personal scoreboard”. Avoid extraneous visuals that don’t directly help the rep improve their sales. The design is clean and focused, with ample whitespace around the charts and table so the rep can easily click and scroll. If the rep page has fewer visuals, you can slightly increase spacing to avoid a sparse look – e.g. if only a couple of charts and a table, maybe make the charts a bit taller or add an illustrative icon or image (like a faint background illustration related to sales) to fill space aesthetically. Just ensure any such image is low-opacity and doesn’t interfere with data (for example, a company logo watermark behind the KPIs).
    Business Development (BD) Dashboard Page
    Layout Structure and Zones
    Grid: Uses the same 12-col, 3-row grid for uniformity. The BD page focuses on lead generation and conversion metrics. Layout is similar: top KPIs, middle charts, bottom details.
    Zones:
    Top Zone (BD KPIs) – 4 KPI cards (3-col each) for BD metrics: New Leads, Opportunities Created, Conversion Rate (% Lead -> Deal), Revenue from New Business. Positioned and sized as on other pages.
    Middle Zone (Lead Analytics) – Two half-width visuals side by side (6 cols each). One might be a leads trend or breakdown chart, the other a funnel visual focusing on conversion stages or pipeline of new deals.
    Bottom Zone (Leads Details) – Likely a table of leads or opportunities, full width or split into two smaller visuals (e.g. a table and a pie chart of lead sources). The content will reflect BD’s need to track pipeline quality and sources.
    Visual Components
    KPIs (4) – Card visuals summarizing BD performance: e.g. Leads Generated (MTD), Qualified Opportunities, Lead-to-Opportunity Conversion %, New Business Sales. Each card 3-col wide, styled uniformly. KPI values might be smaller numbers but still use ~25pt font for consistency, labels ~12pt
    medium.com
    . For conversion rate, include a percentage sign and perhaps an icon (↗️ arrow or funnel icon) to signify direction. Use conditional formatting: e.g. if conversion % is above target, green highlight, if low, red. If New Business Sales is a KPI, that could be $ value – format in shorthand (e.g. $250K). Also possibly include Avg Deal Size or Sales Cycle Days if relevant as a KPI; if more than 4 metrics are important, consider a multi-row card or show less critical ones in a tooltip.
    Leads Trend Chart – Perhaps a Line chart showing New Leads by Month. Size ~6 columns x 2 rows. Title “New Leads Over Time”. This chart should clearly show seasonality or growth of lead generation efforts. X-axis monthly, Y-axis count of leads. Data labels at the end of the line or on peaks to call out record highs, formatted as whole numbers. If the BD team cares about multi-category trends (e.g. split by source or region), consider using a Stacked Area chart variant to show total leads area with colored sub-areas by source. Otherwise a single line is fine. Include an average line or target line for monthly leads if one exists. Provide drill-down if data has hierarchy (Year->Month).
    Conversion Funnel – A Funnel chart or Stacked Bar showing the lead conversion pipeline: e.g. Leads → Qualified → Proposals → Wins. Size ~6 columns x 2 rows. Title “Lead Conversion Funnel”. Use distinct stage colors (consistent with previous funnel usage). Each section’s value and % should be labeled. If using a funnel visual, it directly shows drop-off; if a stacked horizontal bar is used, it could show counts at each stage in one bar with different segments (though funnel visual is more straightforward for conversion). This is a key visual for BD, highlighting where in the process the biggest drop-offs occur. You might configure tooltip here to show conversion % between stages (not just cumulative). E.g., a custom tooltip page that, when you hover “Qualified”, it says “75% of leads qualified (25% drop-off)”. This adds insight beyond what the funnel shapes alone show.
    Lead Source Pie/Bar – (Optional, if space allows) A Donut or Column chart showing Leads by Source (e.g. Web, Email, Events, Referral). Could be placed if the bottom zone is split. For example, a donut chart (6 cols wide, 1.5 rows tall) visualizing the proportion of leads from each source. Legend with source names at ~9pt or use direct labels with % on slices. This helps BD quickly see which sources are most fruitful. If not a donut, a horizontal bar chart with lead counts per source can be used for clarity (with bars colored distinctly).
    Leads Detail Table – A Table of current high-value leads or recently acquired leads. Full 12-col width if alone (or 6-col if sharing with another visual). Columns example: Lead Name, Source, Stage, Value, Owner/Rep. Use ~10pt font. If focusing on new business deals, perhaps list Top 10 Open Opportunities (for BD context, these are deals in pipeline that came from new leads). Conditional formatting: highlight leads older than X days in red (stale leads), or highlight the highest value lead. You could also use data bars in the Value column to visualize relative sizes. This table should allow the BD user to filter or sort easily (maybe instruct them via the tooltip that clicking headers sorts). Drill-through can be set up from a lead to a detailed CRM page if applicable.
    Interaction Design
    Slicers: Provide filters that matter to BD roles. A Date range slicer (for leads created date or opportunity close date) at top is useful – likely as a dropdown (e.g. “This Year, QTD, MTD” options). Also include a Lead Source slicer (maybe horizontal Chiclet slicer with source icons or just text buttons) so BD can filter all visuals by source quickly – this can reveal how conversion funnel changes per source. Place slicers in the top ribbon (e.g. Year/Quarter on left, Source filter on right). Use icons on chiclet slicer buttons if possible (e.g. a small globe icon for Web, an email icon for Email leads) to add visual flair, with text labels still present. They should function as toggle filters (multi-select off if only one source at a time analysis is needed, or on if they want to combine). Ensure slicer selections are obvious – perhaps reflect them in the page title (“Lead Dashboard – 2025 Q4 – [Selected Source]”).
    Drill/Navigation: BD page will also have the navigation buttons (with “BD” highlighted). Within the page, implement drill-down on the Leads Trend (e.g. Year to Quarter to Month) if needed. For the funnel, not much drill-down (could go to underlying data if stage is clicked, but better via drill-through). Drill-through: allow BD to jump to details. For example, right-click on the “Proposals” stage of the funnel could drill through to a page listing all proposals (a detailed list filtered to that stage). Or clicking a slice of the lead source pie could drill through to a list of leads from that source. Setting up a generic Leads Detail drill-through page (with a table of leads) that accepts filters (source, stage, timeframe) would be very useful – all summary visuals can drill to it. Indicate this capability with tooltips or a subtle UI prompt (small info icon “Right-click for details”).
    Bookmark/Toggles: If BD needs to see different perspectives, consider toggles. For instance, a toggle to switch the middle charts between Volume and Quality metrics. In volume mode, you show count of leads (as described). In quality mode, maybe you show Avg Lead Score by Source or Conversion % by Source (could be a different visual). A toggle button (perhaps labeled “Show Conversion Rates” / “Show Lead Volume”) can activate an alternate set of visuals via bookmarks. Place such a toggle near the charts, styled as a small outlined button. Default might be volume. This adds depth to the dashboard without crowding it simultaneously.
    Visual Design and Polish
    Branding & Theme: Maintains the report’s theme – colors, fonts consistent (see Global Guidelines). The BD page might use a distinct icon or imagery: perhaps an icon of a funnel or briefcase with a plus sign (to indicate new business) near the title. Page title “Business Development Dashboard” in the header bar with an icon (e.g. 🥇 or 📈) helps distinguish it. Possibly use the secondary color for accent elements here to subtly differentiate from other pages (while staying in palette).
    Background: Similar approach – maybe a light background shape behind the top KPIs. For variety, one could use a shape divider graphic between sections; for example, a subtle wave or diagonal line separating the top KPI area from the charts area (this could be done by a shape or image with transparency). Keep it very light so as not to distract – it’s purely decorative. All section labels (if used) should be consistent style (e.g. bold underlined text for “Lead Sources” section).
    Iconography: Use icons relevant to BD: e.g. a 🔍 (magnifying glass) for leads, a funnel icon for conversion, a chain/link icon for sources, etc. We can use Lucide or Font Awesome icons by importing them as images or using Unicode where possible. For example, each KPI: Leads 🔍, Opps 💼, Conversion %, Sales 💰. In the lead source slicer, as mentioned, little icons on the chiclet buttons add a nice touch (e.g. 💻 for Web, ✉️ for Email, ☎️ for Phone). Ensure these are uniformly styled (all one color, perhaps the dark text color, to integrate with text).
    Conditional Emphasis: The BD page should draw attention to bottlenecks. Use conditional formatting to highlight the worst conversion stage. For instance, if the funnel stage drop from Qualified to Proposal is <50%, make the label or section outline red or put a ⚠️ icon next to the stage name. If a particular lead source has an exceptionally high conversion, highlight it in the lead source chart (e.g. outline that slice). These targeted highlights give the “wow, it shows me exactly where to focus” effect.
    Text and Color: Adhere to accessibility: many BD folks might view this on their laptops or tablets, so text at least 10pt. Use tooltips or short explanatory text where needed (e.g. a small info icon next to “Conversion Rate” KPI that on hover says how it’s calculated). The theme colors applied should include a vibrant color for new leads (maybe the primary blue), and a contrasting one for conversion metrics (maybe an orange or green) – this dual-color approach can differentiate leading vs lagging indicators. Provide a legend or label where needed to decode colors if not obvious.
    Responsive Design: The BD page, like others, will be optimized for mobile separately (discussed next). On desktop, ensure that even if some visuals have lower data (e.g. if only a few leads one month, the charts don’t look empty – maybe set a y-axis minimum or show a “no data” message gracefully). Possibly use the conditional visibility (if available) to show a text like “No leads this period” if relevant filters yield nothing, to avoid blank spaces.
    Global Design & Theme Guidelines
    (These guidelines apply across all pages to ensure a cohesive, professional look.)
    Layout Grid & Spacing: All pages use a uniform 12-column grid on a 16:9 canvas. Set page size 1280×720 and use Power BI’s Snap to grid to align elements. Consistent padding of ~20px between visuals and at page margins is used to create breathing room
    notjustaprettydashboard.com
    . This consistency ensures that elements line up across pages, supporting a strong visual hierarchy and clean look
    notjustaprettydashboard.com
    . All sections and visuals are intentionally aligned to this grid to avoid misalignment.
    Theme Color Palette: A shared theme is applied report-wide
    creatum.online
    . The palette includes:
    Primary Color – #1F4E79 (deep blue) for key highlights, titles, and current selections.
    Secondary Color – #F2C811 (golden yellow) for accents, secondary bars, or comparison highlights.
    Neutral Grey – #F4F4F4 for backgrounds and borders (light grey), and #555555 for standard text (dark grey) ensuring readability on light backgrounds.
    Positive Green – #3BB273 for favorable indicators (up arrows, good performance bars).
    Negative Red – #E02F44 for negative indicators (down arrows, shortfalls).
    Accent Orange – #EA7E25 (if a third accent needed, e.g. to differentiate categories or highlight a specific role’s element).
    These colors are chosen for good contrast and a modern, professional feel. The theme is applied via a JSON theme file so that all visuals (data colors, fonts) start with these defaults. Visuals use these colors consistently: e.g. all KPI cards have the same background color (maybe white) and use the primary color for icons or emphasis; charts use primary and secondary for main series; positive/negative use green/red universally for any up/down metrics. Consistency in color usage reinforces the branding and helps users quickly understand the meanings (green = good, red = alert).
    Typography: A clean sans-serif font (e.g. Segoe UI, Verdana or the corporate font) is used throughout for clarity
    linkedin.com
    . Use a minimum of ~11pt for any body text on desktop for legibility
    thebricks.com
    (most text is 10–12pt; Power BI’s 10pt is roughly ~13px which is acceptable). Titles of visuals are 12–14pt and bold. KPI values are larger (around 25–28pt) to stand out
    medium.com
    . Slicer text is ~12pt so filter options are easily clickable. We avoid extremely small fonts – nothing below 9pt on any view
    learn.microsoft.com
    . Font color is mostly a dark neutral (#333 or #555) on light backgrounds; on any colored backgrounds, we ensure text is white or a very light color if contrast demands (checking accessibility contrast ratios). Consistent text styling (same font size for similar elements like all chart titles the same, all axis labels the same, etc.) is maintained for a polished look.
    Titles and Labels: Visual titles are short and descriptive, in Title Case, and often include the metric and time frame (e.g. “Sales by Team Member – YTD”). Section headers (if separate from visual titles) are styled distinctly (maybe 14pt, all-caps, with an underline or a colored accent line) to indicate grouping. We avoid cluttering visuals with unnecessary labels: axis titles are removed if the context is obvious, gridlines are minimized or removed for clarity
    learn.microsoft.com
    . Data labels are used judiciously – only when they add value and don’t overcrowd (e.g. on the final data point or on small series). We also utilize custom visual headers sparingly – for example, we might turn off the visual header icons on published view to reduce on-screen clutter unless users need export or focus mode (these options can be in a menu instead).
    Iconography & Imagery: The design uses a set of simple icons (from an open-source library like Lucide or Font Awesome) to enhance comprehension. All icons are used in moderation and serve a purpose (e.g. indicating metric type or action). They are monochromatic (using theme colors) and sized ~16–20px. Icons are embedded in text boxes for section headers or as images floating in corners of KPI cards. We deliberately do not use any photograph images or overly detailed graphics to keep the dashboard professional and performance-friendly. Any background image (like a faint logo) is optimized for size and set with high transparency.
    Conditional Formatting & Indicators: Across the report, conditional formatting rules are consistent. Green and red are reserved strictly for positive/negative performance to avoid confusion. We use the same threshold criteria for similar metrics (e.g. targets: >=100% = green, 90–99% = amber, <90% = red) so that an amber on Exec page means the same performance range as an amber on Manager page. Arrows ▲▼ or trend icons are used in tables and KPI cards to indicate direction of change; those icons are uniformly applied (up arrow always green, down always red, flat line for no change perhaps grey). This uniform approach helps users interpret visuals quickly without a legend each time. We also ensure consistency in number formatting: e.g. all currency in $K with no decimals, all percentages with one decimal or whole as appropriate, etc., as defined by the blueprint.
    Navigation & Interactivity: A Page Navigator is present on every page (usually either at the top as a menu bar or on the side) for easy switching
    interworks.com
    . It’s styled identically across pages (same button size, font, color). The active page’s button is highlighted with the primary color and perhaps a bottom border or glow, so users know which dashboard they’re viewing
    interworks.com
    . Navigation is tested to ensure no broken links. Additionally, a consistent “Reset Filters” button (if included) is placed in the same spot on all pages (top right corner, small 10pt text on it) so users instinctively find it. Interactive elements (like toggles or drill-down buttons) are visually obvious: for example, drill-down icons (the double arrow in visual header) are enabled on charts with hierarchies, and we add a subtle text “(click to drill down)” in the visual subtitle or tooltip on those visuals so users know they can interact. The design avoids any custom-coded navigation; it relies on Power BI’s built-in capabilities for reliability. Bookmarks used for toggles are maintained in a structured way and named clearly (for maintainers), and any bookmark navigation includes a subtle animation (via cross-fade) to make the change feel smooth.
    Responsive (Mobile) Layout: A mobile-optimized layout is prepared for phone view using Power BI’s mobile layout feature. Each page is reorganized into a single-column vertical scroll while preserving the content hierarchy
    learn.microsoft.com
    . Only the most critical visuals are included in the mobile view to avoid overload
    learn.microsoft.com
    . For example, on mobile, the top 2–3 KPI cards might be shown (instead of 4, if space is an issue) in a single column, followed by one key trend chart and one key table. Less critical charts might be omitted from the phone layout (users can still view them on tablets or desktops). Visuals are expanded to full width of the mobile screen (~323pt max width) for readability
    learn.microsoft.com
    learn.microsoft.com
    . No two visuals are side-by-side on mobile to prevent tiny unreadable charts
    learn.microsoft.com
    . Fonts scale down slightly on mobile if needed but we keep a minimum of ~10pt even on phone (Power BI will auto-adjust some text; we ensure titles aren’t truncated by using short titles). We remove or hide elements like decorative images or redundant titles on the mobile layout to save space
    learn.microsoft.com
    . Interactions like slicers are optimized: e.g. using a dropdown slicer that occupies a small area rather than a list. We also test the mobile layout for each page: ensuring that a user can, for instance, tap on a bar to see a tooltip without zooming. The design choices (large tap targets, avoiding hover-dependent features) make the mobile experience smooth. For example, on mobile, we rely on explicitly tapping a data point for details or include a summary text instead of expecting hover tooltips. The overall principle is “keep it simple and focused” – each mobile page starts with the KPIs, then the trend, then one detailed visual, to tell a coherent story in a small form factor
    learn.microsoft.com
    . This way, the dashboard’s value is accessible whether the user is at their desk or in the field on a phone.
